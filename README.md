# Exercism Downloader TUI 🐚

#### Little TUI/CLI written in Go, that automate the task of downloading an exercism exercise and then open it with vscode at the right path.

## Purpose 👀

It's my first TUI app, so I wanted something simple but complete (go will just execute commands under the hood...)

## Install

- You'll have to go to the release, download the .exe (for windows only). Otherwise, install go and build it yourself.
- You also must have the [exercism cli](https://github.com/exercism/cli) installed and configured on your machine 💻
- On windows you must have vscode installed
- Then execute it and TADA! ✨
